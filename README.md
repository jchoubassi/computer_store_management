Computer Store Inventory Management System

This program simulates a computer store inventory system. Using the menu, you can act as a worker by viewing, sorting, adding, updating, and deleting devices from the inventory. You can then save the inventory to an updated txt file, separate from the original used to upload the inventory initially. 

Though not necessary, I have included a Makefile for easier compilation, especially for a project a but larger like this.

To comp & run:
make clean
make
./store
